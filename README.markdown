===========

Adds all call log information backed up by an iPhone sync to an iCal calendar
to help you track the minutes you've spent.  Only information on the phone is
used, so only the last 100 calls with contact aliases already in the contacts
list on the phone will be used.

Requirements
------------

* Your phone must be running iOS 4 or up (including 5).
* This software is designed to run on a Mac (tested on OS X 10.7).
